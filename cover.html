					<br>
					<p>To Whom It May Concern,</p> 
					<br>
						
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am a passionate, equity-oriented people person. Having over four years of customer service experience, 
						I am able to smoothly deflate conflict/s while keeping my demeanor professional and cater to client needs in a diligent, timely manner. 
					 In addition to my service skills, I have three months of coding experience using HTML, CSS, and basic Javascript through Justice Reskill. 
					 I hope to use my perceptiveness and personability to forge and further a career in tech!</p>
					<br>
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have occupied leadership roles since grade school. From being captain of different sports teams to holding  
						peer educator and key holder positions at work, my abilities to listen effectively and learn quickly ensure patrons feel safe and 
					comfortable during our interaction/s. Relaxed clients makes for satisfied, long-term clientele and I have found that, generally, when people 
					feel a basic level of trust for someone, they are more willing to communicate thoroughly. Minimal misunderstandings results in the customer being 
					cared for with more attentiveness. Customer fulfillment is a driving force for me and I am highly motivated to exceed expectations.</p>
					<br>
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I believe my background in ethnic studies and women/gender studies combined with my work experience qualifies me to 
					engage with folks from vast walks of life. It's never a bad time to learn something new and having a diverse client base can keep businesses 
					in line with trends, times, and technologies. Thank you for taking the time to read my cover letter!</p>
					<br>
					<p>Best regards, <br>
					<br>
					Sierra Nash </p>
